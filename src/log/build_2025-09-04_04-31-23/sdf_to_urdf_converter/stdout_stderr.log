[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtinyxml2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "tinyxml2",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tinyxml2" with any
  of the following names:

    tinyxml2Config.cmake
    tinyxml2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "tinyxml2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "tinyxml2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "tinyxml2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
